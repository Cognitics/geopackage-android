# GeoPackage Android

GeoPackage Android is a SDK implementation of the Open Geospatial Consortium [GeoPackage](http://www.geopackage.org/) [spec](http://www.geopackage.org/spec/).

The GeoPackage SDK provides the ability to manage GeoPackage files providing read, write, import, export, share, and open support. Open GeoPackage files provide read and write access to features and tiles. Feature support includes Well-Known Binary and Google Map shape translations. Tile support includes URL tile generation and Google Map Tile Providers.

The GeoPackage SDK was developed at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in collaboration with [BIT Systems](https://www.bit-sys.com/index.jsp). The government has "unlimited rights" and is releasing this software to increase the impact of government investments by providing developers with the opportunity to take things in new directions. The software use, modification, and distribution rights are stipulated within the [MIT license](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).

### Usage ###

#### GeoPackage SDK Sample ####

The [GeoPackage SDK Sample](https://git.geointapps.org/geopackage/geopackage-sample-android) app provides an extensive standalone example on how to use the SDK.

#### Example ####

    // Context context = ...;
    // File geoPackageFile = ...;
    // GoogleMap map = ...;
    
    // Get a manager
    GeoPackageManager manager = GeoPackageFactory.getManager(context);
    
    // Available databases
    List<String> databases = manager.databases();
    
    // Import database
    boolean imported = manager.importGeoPackage(geoPackageFile);
    
    // Open database
    GeoPackage geoPackage = manager.open(databases.get(0));
    
    // GeoPackage Table DAOs
    SpatialReferenceSystemDao srsDao = getSpatialReferenceSystemDao();
    ContentsDao contentsDao = geoPackage.getContentsDao();
    GeometryColumnsDao geomColumnsDao = geoPackage.getGeometryColumnsDao();
    TileMatrixSetDao tileMatrixSetDao = geoPackage.getTileMatrixSetDao();
    TileMatrixDao tileMatrixDao = geoPackage.getTileMatrixDao();
    DataColumnsDao dataColumnsDao = geoPackage.getDataColumnsDao();
    DataColumnConstraintsDao dataColumnConstraintsDao = geoPackage.getDataColumnConstraintsDao();
    MetadataDao metadataDao = geoPackage.getMetadataDao();
    MetadataReferenceDao metadataReferenceDao = geoPackage.getMetadataReferenceDao();
    ExtensionsDao extensionsDao = geoPackage.getExtensionsDao();
    
    // Feature and tile tables
    List<String> features = geoPackage.getFeatureTables();
    List<String> tiles = geoPackage.getTileTables();
    
    // Query Features
    FeatureDao featureDao = geoPackage.getFeatureDao(features.get(0));
    GoogleMapShapeConverter converter = new GoogleMapShapeConverter(
            featureDao.getProjection());
    FeatureCursor featureCursor = featureDao.queryForAll();
    try{
        while(featureCursor.moveToNext()){
            FeatureRow featureRow = featureCursor.getRow();
            GeoPackageGeometryData geometryData = featureRow.getGeometry();
            Geometry geometry = geometryData.getGeometry();
            GoogleMapShape shape = converter.toShape(geometry);
            GoogleMapShape mapShape = GoogleMapShapeConverter
                    .addShapeToMap(map, shape);
            // ...
        }
    }finally{
        featureCursor.close();
    }
    
    // Tile Provider
    TileDao tileDao = geoPackage.getTileDao(tiles.get(0));
    TileProvider overlay = GeoPackageOverlayFactory
            .getTileProvider(tileDao);
    TileOverlayOptions overlayOptions = new TileOverlayOptions();
    overlayOptions.tileProvider(overlay);
    overlayOptions.zIndex(-1);
    map.addTileOverlay(overlayOptions);
    
    // Close database when done
    geoPackage.close();
