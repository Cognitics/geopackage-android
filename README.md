# GeoPackage Android

GeoPackage Android is a SDK implementation of the Open Geospatial Consortium [GeoPackage](http://www.geopackage.org/) [spec](http://www.geopackage.org/spec/).

The GeoPackage SDK provides the ability to manage GeoPackage files providing read, write, import, export, share, and open support. Open GeoPackage files provide read and write access to features and tiles. Feature support includes Well-Known Binary and Google Map shape translations. Tile support includes URL tile generation and Google Map Tile Providers.

The GeoPackage SDK Sample App was developed at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in collaboration with [BIT Systems](https://www.bit-sys.com/index.jsp). The government has "unlimited rights" and is releasing this software to increase the impact of government investments by providing developers with the opportunity to take things in new directions. The software use, modification, and distribution rights are stipulated within the [MIT license](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).
